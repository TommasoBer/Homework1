# Homework1
In this directory there are all the completed exercies about Homework1 (ADM). They are devised by the 2 *Problems* given, each problem's folder contains the *Scripts* as a Jupyter Notebook file. There are as many Jupyter files as the sections of the Problem. In each file-section we can find the different exercises, each one in a different cell.

Then, the file "stamps_HackerRank.pdf" contains screenshots from my personal ***Submission Section***, as an unique pdf, in order to prove the performance of the exercises.

In add, there is the trace of Homework1 : "Homework1.pdf"
